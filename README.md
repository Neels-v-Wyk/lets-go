# lets-go
A repo for keeping track of the things I do as part of Alex Edwards' "let's go" book

## Getting started

To keep things clean and consistent, run everything through docker. Build the base image using `docker build -t lets-go .` and run whatever you want via `docker run lets-go yourcommand`
