# lets-go
A repo for keeping track of the things I do as part of Alex Edwards' "let's go" book

## Getting started

To keep things clean and consistent, all the stuff in this repo can be ran from a docker container. It also doubles as the devcontainer for vscode. Build it using `docker build -t lets-go .`
